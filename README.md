**Non -invasive diagnosis of tumors** means checking the presence of cancer without a biopsy (which is the most accurate method for determining tumors). 

Of course, **it is a good idea to constantly use biopsy**, but if the patient is in serious condition, then any surgical intervention can simply kill him. In such cases, you can use an MRI, but it is **expensive** and may not be sensitive enough to detect very small tumors. 

**A relatively new method based on RNA sequencing will be presented as a project**. As a result of the work, it is planned to create a convenient service for doctors who can load RNA data of their patients, and the model will make a prediction about whether a person is sick with cancer or not
